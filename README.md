# CFA
**Confirmatory Factor Analysis using Robust diagonally weighted least squares method (DWLS) in R.**
Using the NOKUT national student survey data obtained from SIKT, I perform a CFA using the DWLS method. 
DWLS is recommended when dealing with data that exhibits high multivariate non-normality. The method evaluates the asymptotic 
variances and utilizes a diagonal weight matrix (Watkins, 2018).
A two-factor model fit the data after the inclusion of a covariance parameter.
